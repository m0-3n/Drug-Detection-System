# Drug Detection System
Your project centers on developing a non-invasive drug detection system that monitors pupil dilation as an indicator of drug use. The system captures real-time data on the pupil's size, analyzing its variations over time. This data is then plotted into a graph, visually representing the degree of dilation. The graph serves as a diagnostic tool for experts, allowing them to assess potential drug use based on established patterns. The approach eliminates the need for invasive procedures like blood tests, offering a quicker and more convenient method for drug detection. This innovation could enhance the accuracy and efficiency of drug testing in various settings.
